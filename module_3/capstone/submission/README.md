Project Description: Random Color Scheme Generator

The Random Color Scheme Generator is a fun web application that generates random color schemes for design and inspiration. It uses the colrorg API as its data source to fetch and display a collection of 7 random color schemes. Each color scheme consists of several colors, and the generated schemes are displayed as small cards on the page.

Functionality:

On page load, the application calls the colrorg API to fetch 7 random color schemes.
Each color scheme is displayed as a card, and each card contains colored boxes representing the individual colors in the scheme.
Users can visit the website and see different combinations of color schemes for their creative projects.
The generator serves as a tool for designers, artists, and anyone seeking fresh color ideas for their work.
